# Prompt Creator mail problems to jrw@mit.edu

This code allows you to control the kind of prompt sent to OpenAI API
We write a node web server that serves up a web page
When the web page is submitted to a route in the web server
a prompt is constructed and sent to OpenAI. The response from OpenaAI
is caught by the web server and sent back to modify the web page.
